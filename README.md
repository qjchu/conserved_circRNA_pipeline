Detailed pipelines for analysing the conservation of circRNAs

## Assembly of full-length circRNAs
1. Download rice circRNAs with back-splicing information form PlantcircBase (http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/plantcircbase/)
2. Duplicated the genomic sequences of circRNAs once and combined to form a pseudo reference sequences.
